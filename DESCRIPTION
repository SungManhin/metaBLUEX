Description: In meta-analysis for continuous outcomes, the classical methods are designed to handle the studies that report the sample mean and standard deviation. 
             However, some researchers choose to report other summary statistics, e.g. quartiles, mean, min/max.
             To effectively utilize these summary statistics in meta-analysis, numerous methods have been developed for estimating the mean and standard deviation. 
             Among these, the BLUE estimators based on generalized least squares have garnered significant attention due to their favorable theoretical properties. 
             This package provides implementations of BLUE estimators for the mean and standard deviation across different scenarios of summary statistics and distributional assumptions. 
             The methods included are as follows: under normality assumption, approximation formulae for BLUE estimators proposed by Wan et al. (2014) <doi:10.1186/1471-2288-14-135>, Luo et al. (2018) <doi:0.1177/0962280216669183> and Shi et al. (2020) <doi:10.1002/jrsm.1429>, 
             approximation for the expectation vector and variance-covariance matrix in BLUE estimators proposed by Yang et al. (2022) <doi:10.1080/02664763.2021.1967890> and Balakrishnan et al. (2022) <doi:10.1177/09622802221111546>; 
             under other location-scale family distributions: approximations for BLUE estimators specifically for the logistic and Laplace distributions (developed by the authors of this package).
